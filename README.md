# Left Field Labs Challenge

This challenge was given to me by Left Field Labs to recreate the Android nav bar, search bar, and "Why Android" page for Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop. I had to use vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. I also had the freedom to use Gulp for minifying my files.

### Prerequisites

Please be sure you have Gulp installed globally before proceeding with this project, if you dont then use the command written below.

```
sudo npm install gulp -g
```

### Installing

To get the project installed please run the below commands

```
npm install
```

And then

```
gulp
```

running the command "gulp" will start up a development server and minify your CSS/JS files.
